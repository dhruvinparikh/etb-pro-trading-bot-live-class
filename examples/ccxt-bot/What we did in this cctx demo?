- Volume Weighted Average Market Pair Price (VWAMPP) 
  - What is volume?
    - The amount of a cryptocurrency that was traded on an exchange is called the volume.

  - What is the true price of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency?
    - It depends on who you ask from: Bitcoin is currently traded on 
      hundreds of exchanges all over the world. 
      Each exchange reports a different price. In fact, people make 
      money from taking advantage of this price difference in 
      a process called arbitrage.
    - So among all these prices which one is the true price of Bitcoin? 
      Letâ€™s take a simple example:
      Suppose there are only two exchanges who report the price of BTC in USD:
        - Exchange1 reports $10,000
        - Exchange2 reports $12,000
        - Which one is the true price?
          1. One way is to report the average of the two prices, i.e., $11,000. 
            The problem with this approach is that there might be only a few trades on 
            Exchange1, but millions of trades on Exchange2. 
          2. So a better approach is to give more weight to the exchange that has 
            more trades (or more traffic).
          
          We would like to give more weight to the exchange with higher volume.
          So assume:
            Exchange1 reports $10,000 with a daily volume of $1 B
            Exchange2 reports $12,000 with a daily volume of $99 B
            
            Now the volume-weighted average price in USD would be:

            VWAMPP = 10,000 * (1 / 100B) + 12,000 * (99 / 100B)  = 11,980

            (CoinMarketCap.com and coinGecko.com are among the leading websites to 
            report a volume weighted average price for each coin which is 
            calculated on hundreds of exchanges.)

            What is VWAMPP?
            - Volume-Weighted Average Market Market Pair Price (VWAMPP) is the average of 
              the market pair prices from all exchanges where each market pair price is 
              weighted by its volume.


          - Exchanges usually report the price of a market pair, 
            for example: BTC/USD = 10,000 means each BTC is 10,000 USD.

          Quote Currency
          - The currency that is used as the reference is called the quote currency.
          Base Currency
          - The currency that is quoted in relation is called the base currency. 
          
          - In this example, BTC is the base, and USD is the quote.
          - exchanges report a volume for each market pair.

        
        Not every exchange reports the price of each cryptocurrency directly in US Dollars (USD)?

        Currency Pairs with Foreign Fiat Currencies:

        Suppose our example two exchanges report the following:
        - Exchange1: BTC/USD= 10,000. Daily volume = 3 B
        - Exchange2: BTC/EUR= 8,000. Daily volume = 1B

        What is the volume average price?
        - Since the first pair is in USD, and the second is in EUR, 
          we should first convert both the price and the volume of Exchange2 
          from EUR to USD, before calculating the volume average price.

          Suppose EUR/USD is 1.2, i.e. each EUR is 1.2 USD. Then we can write:
          - Exchange1: BTC/USD= 10,000. Daily volume = 3 B
          - Exchange2: BTC/EUR= 8,000*1.2. Daily volume = 1*1.2 B

          VWAMPP for BTC = 10,000 * (3/4.2 B) + 8000 * (1.2 / 4.2 B) = 9885.71 

          Suppose our imaginary exchanges report the following:
          - Exchange1: BTC/USD= 10,000. Daily volume = 3 B
          - Exchange2: ETH/BTC= 0.02. Daily volume = 5 M

            What is VWAMPP in USD?
              We need to find two things:
              1. BTC/USD on Exchange2
                Exchange2 only reports the price of ETH to be 0.02 BTC. 
                But what we need is the price of BTC in USD on Exchange2.

                In order to get to BTC/USD, we can write:

                BTC/USD = BTC/ETH  * ETH/USD  = (1 / ETH/BTC)  * ETH/USD

                So if we knew ETH/USD, we can calculate BTC/USD as follows:

                BTC/USD = 1/0.02 * ETH/USD = 50 * ETH/USD

                Assuming we keep a database of all cryptocurrency prices and in our 
                latest calculations we had the VWAMPP of ETH/USD=204, we can write

                BTC/USD = 50 * 204  = 10,200

                

  - Reference : https://github.com/ourarash/crypto-aggregator
    - The code continuously fetches the prices from all given exchanges and 
      calculates the average price, where the price from each exchange is weighted 
      by its volume.
